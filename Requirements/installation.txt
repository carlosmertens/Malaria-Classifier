## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/carlosmertens/Malaria-Classifier
cd Malaria-Classifier
```

2. Download the [Malaria dataset](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/Malaria_Classifier/data`. 

3. (Optional) __If you plan to install TensorFlow with GPU support on your local machine__, follow [the guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system.  If you are using an EC2 GPU instance, you can skip this step.

4. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create (and activate) a new environment.

	- __Linux__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/malaria.yml` to `requirements/malaria-linux-gpu.yml`): 
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/malaria-linux.yml
	source activate Malaria
	```  
	- __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/malaria-mac.yml` to `requirements/malaria-mac-gpu.yml`): 
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/malaria-mac.yml
	source activate Malaria
	```  
	**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV
	```
	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
	```
	- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/malaria-windows.yml` to `requirements/malaria-windows-gpu.yml`):  
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/malaria-windows.yml
	activate Malaria
	```

5. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)** and Step 4 throws errors, try this __alternative__ step to create your environment.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`): 
	```
	conda create --name Malaria-project python=3.5
	source activate Malaria
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	```
	**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV
	```
	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
	```
	- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`):  
	```
	conda create --name Malaria python=3.5
	activate Malaria
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	```
	
6. (Optional) **If you are using AWS**, install Tensorflow.
```
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-gpu.txt
```
	
7. Switch [Keras backend](https://keras.io/backend/) to TensorFlow.
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
		```
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
		```
	- __Windows__: 
		```
		set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
		python -c "from keras import backend"
		```

8. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `Malaria` environment. 
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name Malaria --display-name "Malaria"
```

9. Open the notebook.
```
jupyter notebook malaria.ipynb
```

10. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, before running code, change the kernel to match the Malaria environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > Malaria**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__
