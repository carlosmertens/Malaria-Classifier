# Project: Malaria Classifier App
## Content: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

### Description

Capstone Project for Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

### Install

Follow instructions to create enviroment:

```
requirements/installation.txt
```
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

Code was create in the `malaria_app.ipynb` notebook file. The python files `train.py` and `predict.py` are to be run on the command line as part of the application.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Malaria-Classifier` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook malaria.ipynb
```  
or
